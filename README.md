## Objectives for 2024 AoC:
- Do not use any external libraries (i.e., no pandas, numpy, torch, etc.) - implement all logic with python in-built libs. 
- Note down time complexity for all major processing. 
- No brute-force allowed; solution should be optimal (or near optimal) in time complexity (i.e., in general, $<O(n^2)$). 
- Use IDE debugger as less as possible. 
- Get past Day 15 (ideally reach 25).
